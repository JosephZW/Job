<td>Computer programmers write code to create software programs. This entails initially planning the software, creating models and flowcharts detailing how the code is to be written, writing and debugging code, and designing an application or systems interface.
<td>Computer programmers usually work in offices, most commonly in the computer systems design and related services industry. Programmers normally work alone, but sometimes work with other computer specialists on large projects. Because writing code can be done anywhere, many programmers telecommute. <br><br>
 - Analytical skills. Computer programmers must understand complex instructions in order to create computer code.<br><br>

- Concentration. Programmers must be able to work at a computer writing lines of code for long periods of time.<br><br>

- Detail oriented. Computer programmers must closely examine the code they write because a small mistake can affect the entire computer program.<br><br>

- Troubleshooting skills. An important part of a programmerâ€™s job is to check the code for errors and fix any they find.</td>

<td>Real Estate Broker</td>
<td><img class="td-img" src="Real Estate Broker.png"></td>
<th>Real estate brokers are licensed to manage their own businesses. Brokers, as independent businesspeople, often sell real estate owned by others. In addition to helping clients buy and sell properties, they may help rent or manage properties for a fee. Many operate a real estate office, handling business details and overseeing the work of sales agents.</th>
<th> Most real estate brokers work in the real estate industry in brokerage offices, leasing offices, and other real estate establishments. Workplace size can range from a one-person business to a large firm with numerous branch offices. Many brokers have franchise agreements with national or regional real estate companies. Under this arrangement, the broker pays a fee to be affiliated with a widely known real estate organization. While some real estate brokers work in a typical office environment, others are able to telecommute and work out of their homes. In both cases, however, real estate workers spend much of their time away from their desks showing properties to customers, traveling to see properties for sale, and meeting with prospective clients.<br><br>
- Business skills. Because most brokers are self-employed, they must manage every aspect of their business. This includes reaching out to prospective clients, handling their finances, and advertising their services.<br><br>

- Interpersonal skills. Strong interpersonal skills are essential for real estate brokers, because they spend much of their time interacting with clients and customers. To attract and keep clients, they must be pleasant, enthusiastic, and trustworthy.<br><br>
    
- Organizational skills. Real estate brokers must be able to work independently, managing their own time and organizing, planning, and prioritizing their work.<br><br>
    
- Problem-solving skills. Real estate brokers need to be able to quickly (sometimes immediately) address concerns clients or potential customers may have with a property. They also mediate negotiations between the seller and buyer.<br><br>
